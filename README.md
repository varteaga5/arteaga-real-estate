Welcome to my Phase 4 Project!

To use the application users must login or signup with a unique username and password, once logged in they are taken to the home screen.

The home screen is a list of homes that the user has added, if they have not added any homes, they then can add them. At this point in the development of the application, the user must input the address and a brief description of why and what they like about the house.

From the home screen they can edit the houses on their list by clicking the Edit button. When this is clicked, they are taken to another screen to make edits, the previous info is loaded and they can click cancel if they do not want to make changes. They can also delete a house from their list by clicking remove. There is a link an about page that gives more information about the site.

The user can also toggle between dark theme and light theme, because we know that browsing through houses for a long time can be straining on the eyes! Finally, when the user is done, they can logout.

Thank you for viewing my project!
